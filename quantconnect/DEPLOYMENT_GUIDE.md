# QuantConnect DRL Hedging Algorithm - Deployment Guide

## üîß **FIXED ISSUES**

### ‚úÖ **Model Loading Fixed**
- **Problem**: Algorithm was loading placeholder model weights instead of actual trained RecurrentPPO model
- **Solution**: Extracted real model weights from `src/results/lossabs_final/final_model.zip` and created proper QuantConnect-compatible files

### ‚úÖ **Algorithm Improvements**
- **Added**: 5-day warmup period to ensure data availability
- **Added**: Enhanced data validation with `UpdateAvailableOptions()` method
- **Added**: Comprehensive error handling in `ExecuteOptionTrades()`
- **Added**: LSTM hidden state reset at market open for better performance
- **Increased**: Trade sizing for more realistic hedging (max_trade_per_step: 3‚Üí10, max_contracts: 20‚Üí50, shares_to_hedge: 1000‚Üí5000)

### ‚úÖ **Model Validation**
- **Tested**: Model loading and prediction pipeline locally ‚úÖ
- **Verified**: Model makes intelligent trading decisions based on market scenarios ‚úÖ
- **Confirmed**: Observation vector format matches training environment ‚úÖ

## üìÅ **FILES TO UPLOAD TO QUANTCONNECT**

Upload these files to QuantConnect ObjectStore with exact names:

### **Required Model Files** (Upload to ObjectStore)
1. `policy_weights.pth` - Extracted RecurrentPPO policy network weights
2. `normalization_stats.pkl` - VecNormalize statistics (obs_mean, obs_var)  
3. `architecture_info.pkl` - Model architecture configuration

### **Algorithm Files** (Add to project)
1. `main.py` - Enhanced main algorithm with warmup, data validation, increased sizing
2. `model_wrapper.py` - Clean model wrapper with proper SB3‚ÜíQC weight mapping
3. `option_calculator.py` - Black-Scholes options pricing (if not already present)

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **1. Upload Model Files to ObjectStore**
```bash
# In QuantConnect IDE, go to Object Store and upload:
- policy_weights.pth (1.2MB)
- normalization_stats.pkl (1KB) 
- architecture_info.pkl (1KB)
```

### **2. Update Algorithm Files**
- Replace existing `main.py` with enhanced version
- Replace existing `model_wrapper.py` with clean version
- Ensure `option_calculator.py` is present

### **3. Run Backtest**
- **Start Date**: 2023-01-01 (or later)
- **End Date**: 2024-01-01 (or current)
- **Capital**: $1,000,000
- **Resolution**: Minute data

## üìä **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**

### **Startup Logs**
```
RL Hedging Algorithm Initialized
Warmup period complete - starting trading  
RL Model loaded successfully from ObjectStore
SB3 weights mapped and loaded successfully
```

### **Trading Logs**
```
Model predicted actions: call=-0.437, put=0.239
Scaled trades: call=-4, put=2 (from actions -0.437, 0.239)
Found options: call=SPY 220121C00400000, put=SPY 220121P00400000
Call trade executed: -4 contracts, cost: $0.20
Put trade executed: 2 contracts, cost: $0.10
```

### **Performance Indicators**
- **Active Trading**: Should see regular option trades (every hour during market)
- **Intelligent Decisions**: Actions should vary based on market conditions
- **Risk Management**: Position limits respected (max 50 contracts per type)
- **Portfolio Hedging**: Maintains ~5000 SPY shares as base position

## üîç **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Model Loading Issues**
- **Error**: "Error loading model" ‚Üí Check ObjectStore files uploaded correctly
- **Error**: "Error mapping SB3 weights" ‚Üí Verify policy_weights.pth is valid

### **Trading Issues** 
- **No trades**: Check "No options with valid pricing data available" logs
- **Failed orders**: Monitor "does not have valid data, skipping trade" messages
- **Low activity**: Increase logging frequency or reduce trade thresholds

### **Performance Issues**
- **Memory**: Algorithm uses PyTorch (CPU-only), should be manageable
- **Speed**: LSTM forward pass is fast, minimal performance impact expected

## üìà **VALIDATION METRICS**

### **Model Performance** 
‚úÖ **Prediction Range**: Actions in [-1, +1] range (proper tanh output)
‚úÖ **Market Response**: Different actions for different market scenarios
‚úÖ **Risk Management**: Responds to existing positions and Greeks

### **Algorithm Performance**
‚úÖ **Data Handling**: Proper warmup and validation checks
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch blocks
‚úÖ **Position Tracking**: Accurate contract counting and limits
‚úÖ **Cost Calculation**: Transaction costs included

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

1. **Model Loads**: "RL Model loaded successfully" in logs
2. **Active Trading**: Regular option trades every hour during market hours  
3. **Intelligent Decisions**: Varying actions based on market conditions
4. **Risk Controls**: Position limits and data validation working
5. **Hedge Performance**: Effective delta hedging of SPY position

The algorithm is now ready for deployment with the actual trained model weights! üöÄ
